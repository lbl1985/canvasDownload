**Module 1: Hypothesis Testing**

**Overview**

Hypothesis testing will build on the topic of confidence interval, thus it belongs to the category of inferential statistics. We will learn how this process will work. While we can’t use statistics to prove anything (remember we are always relying on the sample, and we could be unlucky and get a non-representative sample) – but we certainly can reject a claim on the basis of how likely it is for it to be true based on the data we have analyzed.

This module makes you feel as if you are in the court. The claim that defendant is innocent is what we will call the null hypothesis. The prosecution will want the jury to find the defendant guilty, which is the alternate hypothesis. The data is your evidence. The analysis of this data will either point you to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternate. or if the data doesn’t provide enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis, we will retain the null.

In this module, we will learn how to state the null and alternate hypotheses and how to reach the conclusion of rejecting or not rejecting the null hypothesis.

**Time**

This module should take approximately 3 hours of dedicated time to complete, with its videos and assignments.

**Lessons**

The lessons for this module are listed below (with assignments in bold italics):

**Goals and Objectives**

Upon successful completion of this module, you will be able to:
  - Explain what hypothesis testing is.
  - State the null and alternate hypothesis.
  - Compare one-tailed and two-tailed tests.
  - Perform a hypothesis test about the population mean.
  - Perform a hypothesis test about the population proportion.
  - Reach a decision about the null hypothesis.

**Key Phrases/Concepts**

Keep your eyes open for the following key terms or phrases as you interact with the lectures and complete the activities. Many of the terms are defined in the GlossaryOpens in a new tab.
  - Null hypothesis
  - Alternate hypothesis
  - Level of significance
  - Type I and type II errors
  - One-tail test and two-tail test
  - P-value and how to use it
  - Connection between hypothesis testing and confidence intervals

**Guiding Questions**

Develop your answers to the following guiding questions while watching lectures and working on assignments throughout the module.
  - How do you state the null and alternate hypotheses?
  - What does level of significance mean?
  - What are type I and type II errors, and why do they occur?
  - When is the test a one-tail test, and when is it a two-tail test?
  - What are the steps in hypothesis testing?
  - How do you use the p-value to either reject or retain the null hypothesis?

You can get/give help via the following means:
  - Use the Learner Help CenterOpens in a new tab to find information regarding specific technical problems. For example, technical problems would include error messages, difficulty submitting assignments, or problems with video playback. If you cannot find an answer in the documentation, you can also report your problem to the Coursera staff by clicking on the Contact Us! link available on each topic's page within the Learner Help Center.
  - Use the Content IssuesOpens in a new tab forum to report errors in lecture video content, assignment questions and answers, assignment grading, text and links on course pages, or the content of other course materials. University of Illinois staff and community TAs will monitor this forum and respond to issues.
